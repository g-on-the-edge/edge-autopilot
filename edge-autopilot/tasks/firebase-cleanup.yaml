    prompt: >
      In Edge Oracle, find all Firebase-related files that can be deleted:


      1. Search for files with "firebase" in the name

      2. Search for deprecated service files that re-export Supabase versions

      3. Check these specific files:
         - src/services/executiveRoundsService.ts (should be deprecated wrapper)
         - src/services/executiveRoundsInvitationService.ts (should be deprecated wrapper)
         - src/context/AuthContext.tsx (if it's just a wrapper)
      4. Search for any Firebase config files

      5. Create ./audit/firebase-cleanup.md listing files safe to delete vs
      files to keep


      Do not ask questions - just do it.

    description: Delete deprecated Firebase service wrappers
    prompt: >
      In Edge Oracle, delete deprecated Firebase service files:


      1. Check if executiveRoundsService.ts is just a re-export of Supabase
      version
         - If yes, find all imports and update them to import from executiveRoundsServiceSupabase.ts directly
         - Then delete executiveRoundsService.ts
      2. Check if executiveRoundsInvitationService.ts is just a re-export
         - If yes, update imports and delete it
      3. Update any other files importing from the old services

    description: Remove Firebase config if unused
    prompt: |
      In Edge Oracle, check Firebase configuration:

      1. Find src/lib/firebase/ or similar config directory
      2. Search for any files still importing from Firebase config
      3. If nothing imports Firebase config, delete the config files
      4. If some files still need Firebase (e.g., Cloud Functions), document why
      5. Remove firebase from package.json dependencies if completely unused

      Do not ask questions - just do it.

  - id: clean-auth-context
    status: complete
    description: Clean up deprecated AuthContext
    prompt: |
      In Edge Oracle, clean up AuthContext:

      1. Check src/context/AuthContext.tsx
      2. If it's just a wrapper around SupabaseAuthContext, find all imports
      3. Update imports to use SupabaseAuthContext directly
      4. Delete AuthContext.tsx if no longer needed
      5. Or keep it as a simple re-export if many files depend on it

      Do not ask questions - just do it.

    description: Verify cleanup and build
    prompt: >
      In Edge Oracle, verify the Firebase cleanup:


      1. Run: npm run build - fix any errors

      2. Search for remaining Firebase imports:
         grep -rn "from.*firebase" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" | head -20
      3. Count total Firebase references:
         grep -rn "firebase" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" | wc -l
      4. Update ./audit/firebase-cleanup.md with final status

      5. List any Firebase code that must remain and why
