      Improve Edge Autopilot at /Users/g/VScode-Programs/Projects/edge-autopilot/edge-autopilot
      
      Fix src/supervisor-v2.js to stream Claude Code output to the dashboard:
      
      1. Change stdio back to ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']
      2. Properly handle stdout/stderr streams WITHOUT causing hangs:
         - Use proc.stdout.on('data') to capture output
         - Write to process.stdout for terminal display
         - Call this.dashboard.addOutput(text) for WebSocket broadcast
         - Handle backpressure properly
      3. Make sure the process completes normally (don't hang)
      4. Test that output appears in dashboard Live Output panel
      
      The previous pipe implementation hung - fix that issue.
      
      Do not ask questions - just do it.

      Fix Edge Autopilot dashboard stats at /Users/g/VScode-Programs/Projects/edge-autopilot/edge-autopilot
      
      The dashboard shows 0 for all stats even when tasks complete.
      
      1. Check src/supervisor-v2.js - verify updateStats() is called
      2. Check src/dashboard.js - verify WebSocket broadcasts stats
      3. Check the HTML client - verify it receives and displays stats
      4. Add console logging to trace the issue
      5. Fix whatever is broken
      
      Do not ask questions - just do it.

  - id: session-complete-fix
    description: Fix premature session complete message
    prompt: |
      Fix Edge Autopilot dashboard showing "Session Complete" too early:
      
      1. Check when sessionComplete() is called in supervisor-v2.js
      2. It should only show after ALL tasks finish, not after first task
      3. Fix the logic so it waits for entire queue to complete
      
      Do not ask questions - just do it.
