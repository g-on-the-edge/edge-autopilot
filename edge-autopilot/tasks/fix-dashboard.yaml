      Fix Edge Autopilot dashboard live output at
      /Users/g/VScode-Programs/Projects/edge-autopilot/edge-autopilot


      Problem: Live Output panel shows "0 lines" - Claude Code output isn't
      streaming to dashboard.


      Current state: stdio is set to 'inherit' which sends output to terminal
      but not dashboard.


      Fix src/supervisor-v2.js runSingle() method:

      1. Change stdio to ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe'] 

      2. Add stdout/stderr handlers that:
         - Write to process.stdout/stderr (so terminal still shows output)
         - Call this.dashboard.addOutput(text) to broadcast via WebSocket
      3. Make sure to handle the data events properly to avoid hanging

      4. Use setEncoding('utf8') on the streams


      Also check src/dashboard.js:

      1. Verify addOutput() method exists and broadcasts to WebSocket clients

      2. Verify the client HTML receives and displays the output


      Test by running: node src/cli.js run "echo hello"

      Fix Edge Autopilot dashboard stats not updating at
      /Users/g/VScode-Programs/Projects/edge-autopilot/edge-autopilot


      Problem: Dashboard shows 0 for completed/failed/files even after tasks
      finish.


      Debug and fix:

      1. In supervisor-v2.js - verify sessionStats is being updated

      2. In supervisor-v2.js - verify this.dashboard.updateStats() is called
      after task completion

      3. In dashboard.js - verify updateStats() broadcasts via WebSocket

      4. In dashboard.js - verify the HTML client receives stats updates

      5. Add console.log statements to trace the flow if needed

      6. Fix whatever is broken

      Test the Edge Autopilot dashboard fixes:

      1. Create a simple test task file:
         tasks/dashboard-test.yaml with 2 quick tasks
      2. Run: node src/cli.js autopilot -t ./tasks/dashboard-test.yaml
      3. Open http://localhost:3847 and verify:
         - Live Output shows Claude's responses
         - Stats update as tasks complete
         - Current Task shows correct task
      4. Report what works and what doesn't

      Do not ask questions - just do it.
