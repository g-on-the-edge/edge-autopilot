# Example Task Queue for Edge Oracle
# Add your tasks here and run: npm run autopilot
#
# PROVIDER SELECTION:
# Default provider is set in config.yaml or via CLI --provider flag
# Options: claude | openai
#
# MODEL SELECTION:
# Each task can specify a model: opus | sonnet | haiku (works for both providers)
#
# Claude models:
# - opus: Most capable, highest cost - use for complex tasks
# - sonnet: Good balance of cost/capability - recommended default
# - haiku: Fastest/cheapest - use for simple tasks
#
# OpenAI models:
# - gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4: High capability
# - gpt-3.5-turbo: Faster/cheaper
# - o1, o1-mini: Reasoning models
#
# If not specified, uses config.yaml default or CLI --model flag

tasks:
  # High priority - do these first (use opus for complex analysis)
  - id: buyer-helper-enhancement
    priority: high
    model: opus  # Complex task - use most capable model
    description: Enhance Buyer Helper PDF parsing
    prompt: |
      Look at the Buyer Helper app and improve the PDF parsing logic.
      Specifically:
